# Hyatt-Prescriptive-Analytics
This is a data science project done in R to analyze the Hyatt Hotel Dataset in different countries. The main aim of the project is to give recommendation to the Hotel on different measures to increase the Net Promoter Score.
I have created an interactive display of my results using R-shiny application which is dynamic and super interactive.
